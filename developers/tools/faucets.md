title: Faucet
description: When creating a Dapp, it is generally a good idea to run it on test network before deploying it to a Mainnet. To do that, you're going to need some cryptocurrency to test with. Luckily, faucets exist to supply you with all the test coins you'll ever need. Test faucets are a way for developers to get some tokens to test on the Testnet (Mastery) with.

## Details

You can request 10 `AION` every 24 hours per address. If you need more than 10 `AION` in a 24 hour period, create another Aion address and request tokens to that account, then transfer them to your main wallet.

The test faucet is maintained by [BlockX Labs](https://www.blockxlabs.com/) and was commissioned by a grant from the Aion Foundation.
