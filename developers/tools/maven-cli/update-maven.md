description: Because Maven is a command-line tool, updating any projects with a new Maven package requires some modification of the project configuration file and removal of the library folder.

Follow this process to update the Aion plugin for Maven. All terminal commands are the same across operating systems.

1. Change the `aion4j` version variable within your projects `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<name>helloworld</name>
<properties>

    ...
    <aion4j.plugin.version>0.5.4</aion4j.plugin.version>
    ...

</properties>
```

2. Rename or delete the `lib` folder within your project. Renaming the project to something like `lib-old` is safer since you can revert to it if something goes wrong. Run the following line in a terminal or command prompt:

```bash
mv lib lib-old
```

3. Re-initialize your project:

```bash
mvn initialize
```

4. Check that your project successfully builds. If it does, you can remove the old `lib` folder:
    1. Linux / MacOS: `rm -rf lib-old`
    2. Windows: `rmdir lib-old`

5. You're done! You can now build your project using a new version of Maven.
