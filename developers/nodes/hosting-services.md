Spin up your own private node incredibly quickly. Instead of having to deal with compiling your own package and hosting your own hardware, Blockdaemon allows you to spin up a test net in minutes and validate your smart contract.

## Limitations

There are some limitations with most node hosting providers. The main one being that they do not mine transactions. They just hold a complete copy of the ledger. Because of this, node hosting services do not contribute to the hash power of the Aion network.

Another limitation is that hosting providers often place soft limits on the number of calls you can place to each node. This is to prevent spam and DDoS attacks on the hosting providers.

Make sure to check with each hosting provider to see what the specific limitations of each platform are. Different hosting providers have different limitations.
