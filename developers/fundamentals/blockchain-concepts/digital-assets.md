title: Digital Assets
description: In 2009, Bitcoin gave us the first provably scarce **digital asset** for the masses. Today, we have a multitude of digital asset designs that allow society to digitize assets, programmatically pay for services, securely hold value and much more.

The prevailing business model of the internet, used by Google, Facebook and others are one of exploitation and manipulation. We need to come up with new, less intrusive business models, which don't involve selling off your customer's private data. At the center of this shift are digital assets and cryptocurrency. This section is a primer on designs achieving success in the space.

## What a Digital Asset It

In its raw form, a _digital asset_ is anything that exists in a binary format and comes with the right to use, however for your purposes we'll focus on a subclass of digital assets, notably _coins_ and _tokens_ that are programmatic, use cryptography and distributed ledgers to secure their value.

### The Power of Incentives

As you'll see from the next section, digital assets on the blockchain are such a novel invention because they shift our profit motive from the individual to the collective. Tokens enable us to align the interests of all participants in a network towards a common end!

From **individual value creation:**

- Private actors extract value from society.
- Individual profit maximization.
- Externalization of costs where possible.
- Internalizing private profit.

To **collective value creation:**

- Incentivize purpose of the network with a network token.
- Collective value creation instead of individual value creation.

### Tokens

Tokens are not a new thing, you have likely handled tokens in your daily life whether it be money-themed tokens like flight miles, loyalty program rewards, casino chips or computing based tokens like access rights to documents, or computing operations. Tokens are _a combination of value representation and/or access rights_.

In a blockchain, the term _token_ is used a few different ways in relation to cryptocurrency, but in actuality, it refers to a cryptographic string of numbers and letters that contains no real data but relates back to real data. You _tokenize_ data in order to encrypt it when it passes open and exposed on the internet.

A token might looks something like this:

```text

```

Much of the early innovation in blockchain came from a simple idea. You can create a store of value by setting a scare number of tokenized bits in a shared, decentralized ledger. Since then, we've seen a proliferation in the types and designs of tokens, many of which are not easily classifiable as they have a hybrid function. However, we can reason about the classifications of these tokens from four perspectives.

In a blockchain, tokens are a combination of value representation and/or access to rights. This broad scope makes it non-trivial for determining how you should design your token, however, we're here to help. In order to identify the desired characteristics of your token, we will walk through four considerations.
