title: ABI Types
description: While Java blockchain applications don't need to use an ABI, they are handy if you're sharing a contract with other developers. If they don't have access to the original Java classes, developers can use the ABI to learn what methods and variables are available.

The following ABI types are available when calling or interacting with a Java contract, form outside of the contract. No other types can be used. Each type can be used in an array, however only primitive types can be used within two-dimensional arrays.

| Type | Array Dimensions |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| byte | 1D, 2D |
| boolean | 1D, 2D |
| char | 1D, 2D |
| short | 1D, 2D |
| int | 1D, 2D |
| float | 1D, 2D |
| long | 1D, 2D |
| double | 1D, 2D |
| Address | 1D |
| String | 1D |
