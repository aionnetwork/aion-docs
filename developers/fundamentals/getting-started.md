# Getting Started

So you want to build contracts on the Aion network? This article lists out each step you should take in order to fully understand the blockchain world, and how to build upon it.

Other devs just wanting to use the Open SDKs should [go here](example.com). Developers who want to focus on wallet and exchange intergrations, check out the [integrations section](example.com).

## Understand Blockchain

The blockchain world is substantially different from how things work in regular developer land. There are lots of nuances and special considerations to keep in mind when creating a blockchain application. Therefore it is important to have a solid understanding on _what_ blockchain is, _how_ it's useful, and _how_ it works.

## General Workflow

This is how contract development works:

1. Write
2. Test
3. Compile
4. Deploy
5. Interact

## Contract Tooling

These are the suggested tools for creating your contracts.

### Maven CLI

<!-- TODO: What is it? -->
<!-- TODO: How does the embedded AVM work? -->

### IntelliJ Plugin

<!-- TODO: What is it? -->
<!-- TODO: How does it work with Maven CLI and the embedded AVM? -->

## Interaction APIs

### What we mean by frontend

<!-- TODO: explain what we mean by frontend, and how it works in the blockchain world. -->

### Web3.js

<!-- TODO: What is this? JS Framework that lets you call from and send requsts to the blockchain. -->
<!-- TODO: Define usecases -->

### Ethers.js

<!-- TODO: What is this? JS Framework that lets you call from and send requsts to the blockchain. -->
