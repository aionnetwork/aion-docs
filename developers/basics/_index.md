If you're new to blockchain development, or just want to get to grips with the Aion ecosystem quickly, these tutorials are a great place to start. They've been created to carefully introduce new concepts in a friendly and comfortable way. We've stayed away from confusing jargon and _blockchain-speak_ to make the learning curve that little bit shorter.

## IntelliJ & Aion4j

The IntelliJ IDE is the most popular working environment for Java developers. Learn how to set up an Aion blockchain project within IntelliJ, and manage the writing, compiling, testing, deployment, and interact with your smart contracts. All within one IDE.

## Maven CLI

Maven has long been a favorite build tool of the Java community and it has now been incorporated into the Aion ecosystem! This tutorial walks you through how to write, compile, deploy, and interact with your smart contracts. The Maven CLI also comes with the added benefit of being able to deploy and interact with your smart contracts locally through the terminal, cutting down your development time massively.

## Web3J

If you're creating a standard Java application, but want it to be able to interact with the blockchain, then Web3J is your way forward. With the Web3J framework you can _wrap_ your existing Java blockchain applications within a standard Java application. This tutorial walks you through setting up a simple contract and incorporating it into a standard Java application.
