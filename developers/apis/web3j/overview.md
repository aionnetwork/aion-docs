description: Web3J allows you to connect JVM applications to Aion blockchains with Web3J, a lightweight, reactive, type-safe library for Java, Android, Kotlin and Scala. It does this by wrapping your blockchain application in a standard application wrapper.

Web3J is a highly modular, reactive, type-safe Java and Android library for working with Java smart contracts and integrating with the Aion network. This allows you to work with the Aion blockchain without the additional overhead of having to write custom integration code for the platform.

## How Web3J Works

The point of Web3J is to allow regular _off-chain_ Java applications to talk to the blockchain. There are three steps to this process:

1. Compile a Java contract.
2. Create an importable Java class.
3. Import that Java class into a regular blockchain application.

The [end-to-end example](/developers/apis/web3j/end-to-end) walks you through this whole process, so we suggest you start there if you aren't familiar with the Web3J process.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Web3J, we recommend following the [end-to-end tutorial](/developers/apis/web3j/end-to-end) through. It will give you a good grasp on the basics of integrating Web3J into your standard Java applications. If you've used Web3J before and want to know the process for setting it up on an Aion blockchain, take a look at the [Setup Project](/developers/apis/web3j/setup-project) section.

## Official Documentation

Web3 Labs hosts and maintains the official Web3J documentation. Aion specific [examples](/developers/apis/web3j/examples) and [walkthroughs](/developers/apis/web3j/end-to-end) can be found here.
