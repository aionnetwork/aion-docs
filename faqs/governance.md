###  What is the governance structure?
There wonâ€™t be an on-chain governance structure related to staking in the first version of Unity, however, we are closely watching the latest development and will be considering it in the future. In the meantime, the [Aion Improvement Proposal (AIP)](https://github.com/aionnetwork/AIP) process is a decentralized mechanism to propose improvements to the network that include consensus-related proposals.
