### What is the timeline for launch?

The Unity testnet is currently live and will continue up until mainnet launch scheduled for November 20. Since the Aion Network is a live system, the Unity upgrade will be forked onto mainnet in the first week of November to give the ecosystem sufficient time to ramp up.
