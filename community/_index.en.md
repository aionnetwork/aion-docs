# Community

Community is everything in Blockchain. We're committed to creating the best one.

## Connect

Want to connect with other Aion developers? Check out these resources:

### [Aion Forum](https://forum.aion.network/)

A great place to hang out and chat with other developers on pretty much any topic. This forum is moderated by the Aion Foundation and community members.

### [Github](https://www.github.com/aionnetwork)

The place to be if you have bugs or issues you want to help with. All of the code Aion produces is open-sourced, and it's all stored in [Github](https://www.github.com/aionnetwork).

### Foundation Slack

We're setting up a public Slack channel where you can directly interact with Aion Foundation developers. If you've got urgent questions you're better off posting them on the forum or on [Github](https://www.github.com/aionnetwork).

## Get Help

If you need a hand, check out these resources.

### [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=aion)

StackOverflow is becoming a great place for developers to get answers about Aion development. If you're stuck on something and can't find an answer here in the docs, check out the [`aion` tag at StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=aion).

### [Gitter](https://gitter.im/aionnetwork/Lobby)

A fan favourite of the Github community, Gitter is a great place to get instant answers for kernel related questions. We've got quite a few channels, so join the ones that suit you!
