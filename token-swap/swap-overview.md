## Disclaimer

The Token Swap is now live and production ready. Given the nature of decentralized technology, it is imperative you exercise **extreme caution** when transacting with cryptocurrency. You, and only you, have custody over your tokens and coins, so it is critical you securely store your private keys. When using the Aion Token Transfer Bridge it is recommended that you **perform a test transaction of a small amount** to verify that you are using the correct address and have access to your account.

Here's a high-level overview of what you're going to be doing during this token swap:

1. Create an Aion Wallet that will receive your new `AION Coins`.
2. Choose a method for proceeding with the swap **Bridge** or **Exchange**.
3. Proceed with the step by step documentation for your chosen method.

Now that you're _mentally prepped_ for what's coming up, follow all the steps in this guide to successfully transfer your `ERC-20` tokens to `AION Coin`!
