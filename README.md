Welcome to Aion Docs! This repository holds all the documentation for the Aion Network. The website [docs.aion.network](https://docs.aion.network/) gets content from this repository. The migration of content from this repo to the docs website is currently _not_ an automatic process. As such, this repository is always more up-to-date than the website. This repo should be seen as the source of truth for Aion Network documentation.

This repository **does not** maintain the [docs.aion.network](https://docs.aion.network) website itself. You'll find no `HTML` or `CSS` in these folders, except where used in code examples.

Code examples used in this repository are also available in the [`aionnetwork/docs-example` repository](https://github.com/aionnetwork/docs-examples).
