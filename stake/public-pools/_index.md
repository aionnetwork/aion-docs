title: Public Pools
---

This section outlines the steps you need to do to become a staker on The OAN. In the PoS subsystem of Unity, any coin holder of a system can become a staker and produce PoS blocks. We summarize the staker personas into 3 categories, each having their own dedicated guide:

* Public Pool: a pool that is open for delegation by any coin holder
* Private Pool *(guide in progress)*: a pool that is available for delegation by only a select number of participants that can be configured
* Solo Staker: a staker that does not accept delegation

If you this is your first time staking on The OAN, we suggest you start with running on The Amity Testnet. You will see specific call-outs throughout the guides that you can follow to get set up on Amity.

Despite slight configuration differences, the guides follow the same flow and guidelines. The [Unity section](https://learn.aion.network/docs/account-creation-and-management) highlights the common elements of staking-related components. Below is a high-level overview of how to get started:

1. Learn and get familiar with Unity concepts such as self-bonding, registration, reward distributions and more. You can check out the [Unity Engineering Specification](https://github.com/aionnetwork/unity-engineering-spec/blob/master/unity-engineering-spec.pdf) and [FAQs](https://learn.aion.network/docs/unity-faqs).
2. [Run a Node ](https://learn.aion.network/docs/run-a-node).
3. [Create 2 AION accounts](https://learn.aion.network/docs/account-creation-and-management) that will be needed for operations; one for the management key and the other for the block-signing key.
4. Get AION for self-bonding. If you are running on the Amity Testnet, send a request to the [Aion Service Desk](https://aionnetwork.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/9).
5. Register as a pool - you will need a minimum of 1,000 AION (+ NRG fees) to become active.
6. [Run the block signing tool](https://learn.aion.network/docs/sign-a-node) to be able to sign and produce PoS blocks.
7. You are officially a staker now! Follow the specific guides for more details on configuration and ongoing operations.
