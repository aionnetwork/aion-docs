Test faucets are a way for developers to get some `AION` coin to test with.

## Prerequisites

The only thing you need is an Aion account on the _Mastery_ testnet network. And an internet connection, for obvious reason.

## Steps

1. Navigate to [faucets.blockxlabs.com](https://faucets.blockxlabs.com) in your browser.
2. Select **Mastery** from the **Blockchain Network** dropdown.
3. Enter you public address into **Wallet/Public Address**.
4. Check the **Terms of Service** and **Privacy Policy** checkbox.
5. Check the **I'm not a robot** checkbox.
6. Click **Press to pour**.

## Details

You can request 20 `AION` every 24 hours per address. If you need more than 20 `AION` in a 24 hour period, create another Aion address and request tokens to that account, then transfer them to your main wallet.$$  $$

The test faucet is maintained by [BlockX Labs](https://www.blockxlabs.com/) and was commisioned by a grant from the Aion Foundation.
