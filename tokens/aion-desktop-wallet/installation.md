# Installation

The Aion Desktop Wallet is a local application that is **stored and ran from your local machine**. It is not a cloud application. If you're looking for a wallet that you can access from your phone, tablet, or computer, take a look at [Coinomi](https://www.coinomi.com/en/).

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

| [Linux](#linux) | [macOS](#macos) | [Windows](#windows) |

## Upgrading from a Previous Version

If you are upgrading to the latest Aion Desktop Wallet from a previous version, make sure to follow the steps outlined in the [Upgrading the Wallet guide](https://docs.aion.network/docs/updating-the-wallet). If you are not upgrading, carry on following the instructions on this page.

## Linux

Although it is possible to install the Aion Desktop Wallet on any Linux distribution, Ubuntu is the _officially supported distribution_.

1. Download the `aion_ui.zip` file from the [Aion Wallet Repository](https://github.com/aionnetwork/Desktop-Wallet/releases/)
2. Extract the folder to the desired directory and open a terminal.

## Windows

The `AionWalletSetup.exe` currently isn't signed, which means you may run into some security warnings during the installation process. Just click **OK** through them. We're in the processes of getting all the Aion installation executable signed.

1. If you don't already have it, download and install the [latest stable Java release](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
2. Download the `AionWalletSetup.exe` executable from the [Aion Wallet repository](https://github.com/aionnetwork/Desktop-Wallet/releases).
3. Run the `.exe` on your computer. Accept any security warnings that pop up.
