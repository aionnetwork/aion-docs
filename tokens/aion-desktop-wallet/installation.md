## Windows

The `AionWalletSetup.exe` currently isn't signed, which means you may run into some security warnings during the installation process. Just click **OK** through them. We're in the processes of getting all the Aion installation executable signed.

1. If you don't already have it, download and install the [latest stable Java release](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
2. Download the `AionWalletSetup.exe` executable from the [Aion Wallet repository](https://github.com/aionnetwork/Desktop-Wallet/releases).
3. Run the `.exe` on your computer. Accept any security warnings that pop up.
