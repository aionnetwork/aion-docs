# Networks

There are two options for connecting to an Aion network.

## [Mainnet](mainnet)

This is the live network, where real transactions are processed. `AION` has real-world value here, and transactions are processed by real-world miners.

You can view metrics and information about this network on the [Aion Mainnet Dashboard](https://mainnet.aion.network/#/dashboard).

## [Testnet (_Mastery_)](mastery-testnet)

This test network is sometimes called _Mastery_. It is intended to be used as a testing environment for developers and miners to configure their applications before releasing them on the main network. `AION` has no value on this network, and cannot be exchanged for any real-world money.
