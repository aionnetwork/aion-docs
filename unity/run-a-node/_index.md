title: Run a Node
---

There are two available node architectures that node operators can run:

- [Java](java-node)
- [Rust](rust-node)

They both function in the same way and contain the same features. The only difference is the language that they are written in, and the dependencies each kernel uses. Generally speaking, the Rust kernel is slightly more light-weight and requires fewer resources to run.
